# volleyball_injuries

app contains the shiny app

The .rmd and .ipynb file are the files used for the report.
the R. and .py file are the ones that should be used for the app yet the app is not fully functional yet with both scripts. 
For once because the clmm model doesnt converge and second the xgboost file uses a dataframe that was created within the r file and doesnt use the orginal dataframes.
